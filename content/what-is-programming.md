### Why You Should Learn to Program

We should start my saying that learning any programming language is important
and particularly any textual programming language.

Why, because computers are _everywhere_ and where there are computers there are
_computer programs_ or _software_. Many industries outside of IT use computer
 programming. To list a few:

* science
* engineering
* manufacturing
* transport
* banking
* government
* medicine and health care
* education
* leisure
* tourism
* film making
* architecture/design
* agriculture.

Not every job in these industries require you to program, and not every job in
the future will. But learning computer programing helps you develop your
__computational thinking__.

Computational thinking is an approach to problem solving. It is a way to break
down large and complex problems into smaller problems that you can solve. You
then assemble a sequence of these smaller problems to solve the larger more
complex one.

Computational thinking allows you build models of the world with the right
level of detail looking only at the most important parts of the problem. This
is called _abstraction_. It is a new way to think about the world.

Computational thinking combining ideas from mathematics and logic, to form an algorithm. An algorithm
is a sequence of precise steps that must be followed in sequence to solve a problem.

Computer programmers do this all of the time. You might one day become a computer
programmer but even if you don't computational thinking will still help you. You'll
be able to break any problem down into smaller problems that are more easily
solved.

Now you know why you should learn the program the next question to ask is "Just what
_is_ and compter?"

### What is a Computer

A computer is probably not what you think it is! It is not the thing you are probably
sitting in front of right now reading this. So it is not a laptop, or an iPad or a
smart phone. So if a computer is not any of these things just what is it?

A computer is a actually a person! So you are a computer. The word "computer"
originally meant a person who computes. They would carry out a fixed set of instructions
in an ordered sequence. The instructions they carried out were mathematical calculations,
or sums. This meaning of the word "computer" first appeared over 400 years ago.
Computers are actually a very old idea.

You might be wondering why would anyone do this? Well the types of calculations that
these "computers" performed were important to early science and engineering.
Most of the early "computers" were also women.

What you now think of a computer is more properly a
[stored program digital computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Stored_program_computers_eliminate_the_need_for_re-wiring).
These have only been around for 70 years so.

### What is Programming

So now you know what a computer is, what is programing?

Programming is problem solving activity. You start with a problem, let's say "How do I make a cup of coffee."
and a defined or expected outcome if the problem was solved correctly. So in this case
a freshly brewed hot cup of coffee.

Now you need to workout the ordered sequence of actions that you need to take to
make me a cup of coffee. Working out both the actions and their sequence is programming.

### What is Computer Programming

Computer programming is just like programming. It is still a problem solving
activity. The difference is how you express the steps and who or really what
carries out the steps.

Think about making a cup of coffee again and the steps involved. Two of these
steps might be:

* Open the coffee jar
* Fill kettle

Now think about the different ways you could describe these steps to another person.
You could:

* Talk to them and ask them to do exactly what you say
* Write the instructions down and ask them to read them
* Draw a picture for each step and ask them to follow the pictures
* Make a video and show it to them

The difference between this and computer programming is that you are telling the
computer what to do, not a person. You also have to express the steps in a way that
a computer can understand using a programming language.

### Note - More Teaching Time Required

This lesson needs twice the normal teaching time. This is the first lesson
that the pupils will need to use a text editor to write the Go program
and the command line/terminal window to run the program. It is likely that
the pupils will not be familiar with either of these programs.

The text editor and command line are both essential tools that will be used
in every lesson. Time should be devoted to showing the pupils how to

* Start both programs
* Create a directory
* How to create a new source code file using the text editor
* How to save the source code file
* How to use the terminal to run the program

The phrases "Terminal" is more commonly used in MacOSX or Linux or on a
Raspberry Pi. "Command prompt" is largely used on Windows.

These terms, along with "command line," are largely interchangeable.

### Lesson Objective

To introduce programming in Go and carry out simple mathematics using a
program written in Go

### Success Criteria

* I can start a command prompt or terminal window
* I can start a text editor
* I can type in a Go program
* I can run a Go program
* I understand how to do simple sums in Go

### Key Vocabulary

* Go
* Programming Language
* Text Editor
* Command Prompt
* Terminal Window
* Textual
* Source code
* Integer

### Period of Study

KS2 Emerging

### NC Computing links

Co2/1.1    design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals,
including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by
decomposing them into smaller parts

Co2/1.2    use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with
variables and various forms of input and output

Co2/1.3    use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and
to detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs

### Cross Curricular Links

Maths - interger/whole numbers, simple addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division

### SMSC


### Resources/Homework

The pupils will need to have Go installed on the school computers. They will
also need a text editor installed. For Windows/MacOS X and Linux they should
install Atom. For RaspberryPi they should install liteIDE. See the
[install guides]({{< relref "installing-go.md" >}}) on the website for more
details.

### Starter Activity

Numbers are fundamental to a computer so it makes sense to start here.

Computers process data in the form of numbers. From the computer's
point of view everything is a number. The computer uses logic to process
the data. It does not matter what the data is. It could be a word processor
document, a picture or a music file. These are all just long lists of numbers
to the computer.

Each of the rainbow colours can be given a number e.g. red = 1, orange = 2 etc.
The computer can then use the numbers to represent the colours

Ask the pupils to do some simple mathematics - addition, subtract,
multiplication and division of whole numbers.

### Main teaching points

* Explain that Go has to be typed, in contrast to Scratch.
* Explain that the files the pupils type are called source code
* The source code files contain the sequence of Go instructions
for the computer
* Show the pupils how to start a terminal window/command prompt. How you
do this depends on which operating system you are using.
* Show the pupils how to start the text editor, create and save a file. Again this depends on the platform
* Explain that a whole number is called an integer in Go
* Explain the program task and ask the pupils to type in and run the program.


#### For High Achievers
The pupils should understand that a computer can only process numbers.

The pupils should understand that everything is represented as a series of
numbers inside the computer.

The pupils should be able to open a terminal window, largely without support.

The pupils should be able to open the text editor, create a source code file
and save it, largely without support.

The pupils should be able to type in the numbers program and run it
successfully, largely without support.

The pupils should be able to type in the numbers program and run it
successfully, largely without support.

#### For Middle Achievers
The pupils should understand that a computer can only process numbers.

The pupils should understand that everything is represented as a series of
numbers inside the computer.

The pupils should be able to open a terminal window, with support.

The pupils should be able to open the text editor, create a source code file
and save it, with support.

The pupils should be able to type in the numbers program and run it
successfully, with support.

The pupils should be able to type in the numbers program and run it
successfully, with support.

#### For Low Achievers
The pupils should understand that a computer can only process numbers.

The pupils should be able to open a terminal window, with considerable support.

The pupils should be able to open the text editor, create a source code file
and save it, with considerable support.

The pupils should be able to type in the numbers program and run it
successfully, with considerable support.

The pupils should be able to type in the numbers program and run it
successfully, with considerable support.

### Plenary
Can the pupils write down the answers to these sums:
15 - 3 - 10
20 + 7 - 3 - 8
3 * 3 * 3
56 / 7
Can they work out this
(1 + 2) * (9 - 5)
Brackets can be used in the program and behave as you would expect.

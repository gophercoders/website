### Lesson Objective

To learn what loops are and the pattern for repetition in Go programs
<!--more-->
### Success Criteria

* I know what repetition is
* I know what repetition is used for
* I know what loops are and the different loop types
* I know the patterns for loops in Go
* I know how to use the loop patterns in Go

### Key Vocabulary

* repetition
* loop
* for
* repeat
* repeat until

### Period of Study

KS2 Emerging

### NC Computing links

Co2/1.1    design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals,
including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by
decomposing them into smaller parts

Co2/1.2    use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with
variables and various forms of input and output

Co2/1.3    use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and
to detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs

### Cross Curricular Links

Maths - The pupils must have covered less than, less than or equal to,
greater than, greater than or equal to, equal to and not equal to for
numeric values. The pupils will need to be able to write conditions
that terminate loops.

### SMSC

?????

### Resources/Homework

The pupils will need to have Go installed on the school computers. They will
also need a text editor installed. For Windows/MacOS X and Linux they should
install Atom. For RaspberryPi they should install liteIDE. See the
[install guides]({{< relref "installing-go.md" >}}) on the website for more
details.


### Prerequisites

The example program uses the times tables up to 12, so the pupils
must be familiar with these.

The lesson builds on earlier lessons so the pupils should have
covered Lessons 1-9 in the series

### Starter Activity
Show the pupils how a regular square, triangle, pentagon can be
drawn one step at a time.

Show them that the multiplication is repeated addition.

Show them that in a times table only one number varies. It varies
between 1 and 12 so the entire table is a repetition of a single
multiplication e.g. `3 * n` where `n` is 1..12

### Main teaching points

* Introduce the idea that smaller, similar steps can be repeated to
achieve a larger goal.
* Show what repetition is and what it is used for
* Explain the different loop types
* Show the patterns for loops in Go
* Explain the `timesquiz` program in Go

#### For High Achievers
The pupils should understand that repetition is a repeated execution of a set
of instructions.

The pupils should know that repetition is also called a loop.

The pupils should understand that loops are used to make a program
easier to understand, shorter and to help express algorithms.

The pupils should know that there are three basic loop types.

The pupils should understand and recognise the pattern for a loop that continues
while a condition is true without support.

The pupils should know when the condition in the loop is tested without support.

The pupils should be able to change the `timesquestion` program into the
`timesquiz` program and run it without support


#### For Middle Achievers
The pupils should understand that repetition is repeated execute of a set
of instructions.

The pupils should know that repetition is also called a loop.

The pupils should understand that loops are used to make a program
easier to understand, shorter and to help express algorithms.

The pupils should know that there are three basic loop types.

The pupils should understand and recognise the pattern for a loop that continues
while a condition is true with support.

The pupils should know when the condition in the loop is tested with support.

The pupils should be able to change the `timesquestion` program into the
`timesquiz` program and run it without support

#### For Low Achievers
The pupils should understand that repetition is repeated execute of a set
of instructions.

The pupils should know that repetition is also called a loop.

The pupils should understand that loops are used to make a program
easier to understand, shorter and to help express algorithms.

The pupils should know that there are three basic loop types.

The pupils should understand and recognise the pattern for a loop that continues
while a condition is true with considerable support.

The pupils should know when the condition in the loop is tested with considerable
support.

The pupils should be able to change the `timesquestion` program into the
`timesquiz` program and run it with support

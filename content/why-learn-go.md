There are a few things that make Go a good computer language to learn and particularity
a good first language to learn.

### Designed for _Now_

Go is a very modern language it's only 5 years old. Compare this to
Python, which you might have seen at school, it is actually 24 years old! By contrast
Java and Ruby are 20 years old, C++ is 32 years old and C is 43 years old! Even
Scratch is almost 10.

But the computers we have now a vastly more powerful and different from those we
had 25 years ago. The mobile phone you have in your pocket is more powerful than
a computer was 25 years ago! The problems we are tying to solve with computers now
are also much larger and harder then the ones we dealt with 25 years ago.

It does not make much sense to try to solve the problems we have today, using
programming languages that we designed 25 or more years ago. Today's computers
and problems are different. Go was designed to solve the problems we have _now_
on the computers we have _now_.

### Small and Beautiful

Go is a small language. There are only 25 keywords in the language.
Each of these words has a special meaning in the Go language. These words cannot
be used for anything else. But it means you only have 25 words to remember.

Go has a minimal feature set. The inventors of Go threw away more ideas from other
computer languages than they kept. This keeps Go focused on making things easy for
you to use. You can think about the most important thing - the problem you are
trying to solve.

Go is a very easy to write _and_ read. Every line in a Go program reads logically from left to
right. The rules for this are very simple and easy to learn.

Go programs have the same style. Small, and sometimes large, sections of programs
are written in a similar way, or pattern. Once you spot the patterns you know
immediately what the code is doing.

Go even has a tool that will reformat your code to a standard style, so it is easier
for you and everyone else to read.


### Helpful Debugging

You are going to make lots of mistakes when you start learning Go. So if your
program won't run at all, Go will tell you where the problem is and tell you why.

If your program runs but doesn't work as you expect then you have a mistake
in your program: a bug. You need to fix or debug this. Go makes this easy because
every line has a simple logical structure. All you need to solve the bug is a
pen, some paper and a bit of logical thinking.

Testing that your program works as expected is very important. Go can help you
do this too. You just need to write a test program. Go has a test tool that will
run your test program and the program you want to test. Go then compares the
results of both programs and tells you if they match or not.

Go is helpful. Go comes with a lot of information about the programming language
itself, and the programs that are used to create the programs. So if you want to
know what the `fmt.Println` line really does in the "Hello, World!" program you
can look it [up](http://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Println) easily.

You can also write documentation for your own programs, and the Go makes this easy
and GoDoc tool will format it for you in the same style as the standard Go
documentation.

In addition to this, there are huge amount of information on the [Go website](http://golang.com)
including the Go Wiki, the FAQ and the mailing list, slides and even videos.
If you want to look at how Go itself was written you can do that do [to](http://golang.org/src/fmt/print.go?s=7559:7608#L253 "This the fmt.Println function").

Across the Internet there are even more tutorials, blogs, programming tips,
sides and videos. There are is also an enormous amount of other peoples
Go code look at, read, understand, download and change.

{{< defaultNote >}}
Most of what is available on the Internet assumes you can program in at least
one textual programming language already and preferably Go. So you might not be
able to understand too much to begin with. But as you learn how to program in Go
you will be able to understand much more.

### The Funky Computer Science Bit

Go is a _statically typed_ language. This means that in a Go
program an entire class of mistakes in the program, bugs, can be detected before
the program is even run. It means you have to think a little bit more, but you
never have to debug these difficult errors. It also makes your programs much
easier to understand.

Go is a _compiled_ language. This means go is fast, very fast. Go's compiler
takes your program and turns it into something the computer can understand.
Even for the largest of Go programs, the compiler can do this in under 2 seconds.
But once your program is compiled, you don't need Go any more to run it.
This means you can give your compiled program to someone else they can run it
too, even if they don't have Go installed on their computer, or your source code.

### And

Go is fun to learn. Given the above benefits over other languages, the process of learning Go is more rewarding for the student. We have found that people of all ages have enjoyed learning and eventually mastering, Go. And once mastered, not only can your skills translate to understanding other computer languages, but you will be able to better think constructively and logically to solve a host of real world problems.

### You might not need to do this
If you are at school on a school computer then you do not need to do this.
Your teacher or your school ICT coordinator should have installed [Go](http://golang.org)
for you already.

If you are at home or on your own computer, you will need to install Go.

### Outline

Installing is pretty easy. In fact, it's one of the easiest programming languages to
install and maintain. 

We have taken the official Go
[installation instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install) and the
official Go [workspace instructions](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) and added
more details to make the process clearer.

The steps in the process are:

* Download and install the programs Go needs to work
* Download Go itself
* Install Go
* Setup a Workspace

### Install guides.

Installing Go depends on which operating system your computer has. You need to
follow the install guide for the operating system:

* [Windows 7 and Windows 8 install guide](/install/windows/)
* [Mac OS X install guide](/install/macosx/)
* [Raspberry Pi Raspbian install guide](/install/raspberry-pi/)
* [Linux install guide](/install/linux/)

### Testing Your Go install

Once you have Go installed, you need to make sure that it has been installed
and is functioning correctly. This process is the same for all operating
systems. This is one of Go's advantages.

The instructions are in the [testing your install guide](/install/testing-the-install/).

### Set up an Editor for Go Programming<a name="editor-install"></a>

This last step is _optional_. If you do not already have a specific editor setup
for programming then this step will make typing Go programs a little easier.

If you are using Windows, Mac OS X or Linux we suggest you use the Atom editor.
If you are using a Raspberry Pi we suggest using the liteIDE which is specifically
designed for Go programming. But really, the choice is yours, and a lot of good
text editors are now available, so to start with, pick one you're familiar with or like.

### Who are GopherCoders?

GopherCoders is a creation of [Kulawe Limited](http://kulawe.com). Kulawe is a
small IT consultancy, based in Buckinghamshire, England.

Kulawe's day-to-day business is introducing Agile project management approaches,
using a methodology called [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29).
We try and help companies make better software by changing the processes they
use to make software.

### How did GopherCoders start?

GopherCoders is the result of two events.

The first is the UK Governments
[Department for Education and Skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
decision in September 2013 to radically change the way Computing (prevously
ICT - Information and Communication Technology) was taught in schools. The new
[curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
took effect from September 2014. The changes can be summed up in one simple
sentence.

All children, from the age of four onwards, now have to learn to code using a
computer programming language.

The second event was a conversation with Ben Price - who drew the GopherCoders
logo. Ben is an outstanding primary school teacher. We had looked at the new
computing material available to schools and quickly realised that without a
background in programming that teachers were likely to struggle to teach the new
curriculum. After talking to Ben we realised that the pupils and the schools
would need help.

Out of these two events GopherCoders was born. Initially as a website with aim of
helping pupils to learn at home to program though our on-line lessons and then later
with material for teachers to help them with the lessons if they wanted to use
the material in the classroom. From that we've moved on to holding classes and
coding clubs within schools.

### Why do this at all?

A long time ago(!) we taught ourselves to program, then years later a teacher
taught us some more. The combination of our curiosity and an inspiring teacher
lead us to careers in IT.

Over this time computers have become vastly more powerful and common so
the need for programmers has increased. But, there are less pupils interested in
the subject both at school and university level.

As an industry we need more young people to be interested in the subject at an
early age. We could all program by the age of eleven, so why can't the pupils
of today do that too? We set out the answer this question.

### Why did we choose Go?

Within Kulawe we have used Go to create a number of programs to solve the
business problems we have. We like coding in Go a lot. It is very easy to use,
allows us to solve problems in interesting ways, and has made us more productive.
Wherever possible we try and use Go in our and our clients projects.

There as also been a debate within the Go community about using Go as a teaching
language. Some people have used Go to teach specific programming concepts, but
this has mostly been at the university level. There are very few examples of
people teaching Go to others as a first programming language. And, as far as we
know, there are no examples of teaching children to program with Go.

Because we used Go on a daily basis, Go looked to us like an __ideal__ teaching
language. So we thought we would find some children and try to prove this.

Go, of course, has turned out to be a [specularly good language]({{< ref  "gophercoders-in-schools.md#does-it-work" >}}) to teach children
to program!

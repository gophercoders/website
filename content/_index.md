{{< pageHeaderNoSub >}}Hello, welcome to [GopherCoders.com](/){{< /pageHeaderNoSub >}}
GopherCoders.com is website for school children who want to learn to program.
If you are at school and want to learn to program computers or are just wondering
what all of this computing stuff is about we can help you learn. So if that sounds like you then you've
come to the right place.

GopherCoders.com is a little different from other "How to Program" websites.
At Gophercoders.com we think that it's important that you learn not only the how
but the _why_ of computer programming and can relate this software knowledge to the
computer hardware (the circuitry inside).

Computer programming is both a separate subject with a rich history of its own,
but it is also a tool. A tool that you can use everyday to solve your problems.

And we are going to do all of this with an exciting modern programming language called
[Go](http://golang.org).

We are going to follow the National Curriculum in England for Computing for Key
Stages 2 to 5. When we show you an example or explain a concept we will make it
clear what the Key Stage is for that concept.

So come on a journey with us, into the world of computer programming.

Happy programming!

Atom is a text editor for programmers. It is a more advanced version of Windows
Notepad program that makes programming in general easier. It also has very good
integration with Go.

Installing Atom has two steps.

* Downloading and installing Atom
* Configuring Atom to work with Go.

### Downloading and Installing Go

Atom can be downloaded from the [project home page](http://atom.io).
You just need to click the green "Download Windows Installer" button.

When you see a window asking you to save the file you should select "Save File".

double click the "AtomSetup" to star the install.

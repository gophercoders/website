#### Atom is the Same Everywhere

Now you have Atom installed on your computer you need to configure it
to use Go. This process is the same for computer running Windows, Mac OS X or
Linux.

### Installing Go-Plus

We are going to install an Atom _package_. A package is a little program that
a programmer is written to extend or add a feature to the Atom editor.

To do this we need to open the "Settings" window.
On Windows this is called `Settings` and is in the `File` menu.
On Mac OS X.....
On Linus this is called `Preferences` and is in the `Edit` menu.

CTRL+comma

Once the Settings window appears

You need to click on the `Install` button on the left hand panel.

In the search box type `go-plus`. The Go plus package should be the
first search result.

Now click on the blue `Install` button beside go-plus to start the
install. Or click on the go-plus search result, and then click on the
install.

Once go-plus has installed you will see the the blue `Install` button has
changed to three buttons, Settings, Uninstall or Disable.

Now click settings.

If you installed go-plus by first clicking on the search result then you
will already be in the settings Window.

We don't need to change any of the options. So you can now close the settings
window.

### Installing Autocomplete-Plus

If you like you can also install the Autocomplete-Plus package. You do not
require this package to use Go or Atom but if you install it it will reduce
the amount of typing you have to do.

Go back to the settings instal package screen. If you are still in the Go Plus
settings screen you need to click Install in the panel on the left.

This time search for `autocomplete-plus` You will need to scroll down the list
of search results until you find the autocomplete-plus package.

Again you need to either click on the blue "Install" button to start the install.

Once Autocomplete-Plus is installed you will see the settings screen. You don't need
to change anything so you can just close the settings window.
